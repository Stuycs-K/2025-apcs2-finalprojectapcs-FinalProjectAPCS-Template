### 2025-05-22 - Planning
Tudor was absent so the UML diagrams are not complete with a main/game class. I spent maybe 20 minutes learning about branches and creating mine. The rest was spent doing planning for the pac-man class. 

### 2025-05-23 - Branching and Pac-man
20 mins learning and testing how to branch and merge. 20 minutes writing the basic Pac-man class.

### 2025-05-27 - Map Discussion and MapNode
Spent 15 mins talking to Mr. K about the plan for the map and discussing ourselves how we planned to implement nodes. Then spent the rest of class writing the MapNodes class with a location; mapnodes for up, down, left, right; and an object.
