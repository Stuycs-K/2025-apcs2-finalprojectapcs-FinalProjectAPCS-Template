### 2025-05-22 - Planning
Tudor was absent so the UML diagrams are not complete with a main/game class. I spent maybe 20 minutes learning about branches and creating mine. The rest was spent doing planning for the pac-man class. 

### 2025-05-23 - Branching and Pac-man
20 mins learning and testing how to branch and merge. 20 minutes writing the basic Pac-man class.

### 2025-05-27 - Map Discussion and MapNode
Spent 15 mins talking to Mr. K about the plan for the map and discussing ourselves how we planned to implement nodes. Then spent the rest of class writing the MapNodes class with a location; mapnodes for up, down, left, right; and an object.

### 2025-05-28 - Editing map based on MapNodes
30 mins discussing electives as a class, rest of class spent making the map work with MapNodes and changing location of pac-man and ghosts to MapNodes.

### 2025-05-29 - Moving to Processing and starting to create map
We first moved all the files to Processing and did some work together with only Tudor typing, as we wanted to make sure we understood how the map worked before writing more code that expanded upon that. I moved on to work on the move function for Pac-man in the last few minutes of class.

### 2025-05-30 - Pac-man Movement and ghosts
I spent the beginning of class making Pac-man's movement work exactly as it does in the game. The rest of class was spent working on ghost movement together.

### 2025-06-02 - Ghost Movement
Spent time discussing updates from weekend and next steps to advance from the MVP. I then worked on making Ghost movement similar to Pac-man in that it is smooth, not jumping between nodes. I fixed up the nodes a bit and worked on wraparound.
