Wrote much of nationStates early functions and the constructor we will probably use for most applications, also wrote a Bonds class, will update prototype later for why that decision was made. Probably took about an hour fifteen minutes, maybe a little more across class time and homework time. Will work a bit more on nationState functions today now that I've fixed all compilation errors, probably another thirty or so minutes.
