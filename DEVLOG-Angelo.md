 I outlined a basic UML diagram with abstract class plant, with subclasses peashooter and sunflower. Also a class zombie, with subclasses buckethead and newspaper.

### 2025-05-21 AP + Sick at home :(

### 2025-5-21 (In class) Updated UML
 I updated the UML to reflect the game/main class.

### 2025-5-21 (At Home) Further updated Updated UML
 Added more to the UML structure, including a Pea and Sun class, as well as associated arrays. I also updated the plant class and made a barebones peashooter class.

### 2025-5-22 (In class) Updated UML
 Added more accessor methods to the classes and differentiated between Sunflower Sun and Game Sun. Their only different is in their movement. They will update the static game Sun[]
