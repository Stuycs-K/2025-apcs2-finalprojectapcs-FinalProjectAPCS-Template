### 2025-05-20 UML Diagram
 I outlined a basic UML diagram with abstract class plant, with subclasses peashooter and sunflower. Also a class zombie, with subclasses buckethead and newspaper.

### 2025-05-21 AP + Sick at home :(

### 2025-5-21
 Updated UML
 I updated the UML to reflect the game/main class.

 (At Home)
 Added more to the UML structure, including a Pea and Sun class, as well as associated arrays. I also updated the plant class and made a barebones peashooter class.

### 2025-5-22 Updated UML
 Added more accessor methods to the classes and differentiated between Sunflower Sun and Game Sun. Their only different is in their movement. They will update the static game Sun[]. New interfaces and classes update from Mr. K

### 2025-5-27 More UML Updates
 Added to UML, updated Map and Displayable classes. Also added clickable interface. No more UML stuff hopefully that thing hurts my head.

 (At Home)
 Added the Pea class and updated displayable and projectile. Tried to test the pea class, but resulted in a null pointer exception, will address with group mates.
 Update: Fixed null pointer, but the pea will not move.
