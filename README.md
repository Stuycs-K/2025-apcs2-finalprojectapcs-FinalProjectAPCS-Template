# Project Description

Our goal is to recreate the card game “UNO!” where a user can play against their desired number of bots, with the maximum being four. The user and each of the bots will start out with a deck of seven cards and a random card will be used to begin the game. The user and each of the bots will be able to draw random cards from a deck when needed. The bots will be programmed to place the highest amount of cards possible each turn. Certain cards will have special functionalities such as the Skip card (skips all the other players’ turns), the Reverse card (reverses the direction in which the players take turns), etc.

# Intended usage:
The UNO game will be run from the user's IDE/Terminal. When the program starts, the user is asked to enter the desired number of bots to play against (up to 3). Once the game begins, each player will recieve 7 random cards, with the game starting with a randomly drawn card placed in the center. The user will see the current state of the game (top card, current hand of cards, player's turn, active special cards). During the player's turn, they will be asked to choose a valid card to play or to draw a card if no valid card is available. The player will be able to click on a card in their hand to play it and the bot's move will be automatically displayed and updated.
