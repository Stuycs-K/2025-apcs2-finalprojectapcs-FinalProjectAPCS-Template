# Project Description

This is a single-player game based on the game Diep.io. A player will roam a limited-size map full of automated enemies, polygons that give XP, and bullets flying everywhere. As a player gains more XP, they gain the option to upgrade their class, which gives them better and more versatile weaponry. Players gain XP by destroying polygons, which deal damage on contact, and by killing enemies that roam the map.

# Intended usage:

A description as to how the project will be used (describe the user interface). (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)
  
The user will control their circular avatar with the WASD keys for movement and the mouse pointer to aim their gun. When the gun is clicked, the player will shoot, and there will be a cooldown preventing the player from shooting super fast. As the player gains XP, upgrade options will appear, which can be clicked on to give the player an upper edge. Dying results in the loss of all XP.
