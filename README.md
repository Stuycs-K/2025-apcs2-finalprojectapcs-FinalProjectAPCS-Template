# Project Description

Our goal is to recreate the card game “UNO!” where a user can play against their desired number of bots, with the maximum being four. The user and each of the bots will start out with a deck of seven cards and a random card will be used to begin the game. The user and each of the bots will be able to draw random cards from a deck when needed. The bots will be programmed to place the highest amount of cards possible each turn. Certain cards will have special functionalities such as the Skip card (skips all the other players’ turns), the Reverse card (reverses the direction in which the players take turns), etc.

# Intended usage:
