# Project Description

We recreated Pac Man, an arcade game designed in the 80s.

# Intended usage:

The game is meant to be played using the arrow keys. The player controls the yellow ball, known as Pac Man, and must collect all the dots, known as pellets, around the map. They are also meant to avoid the moving colored balls, which are the ghosts. Upon touching a ghost, Pac Man will lose a life and get sent back to spawn. Once losing 3 lives, Pac Man loses the game and must restart. However, if Pac Man collected a large dot, also known as a power pellet, there will be a brief window where the ghosts turn blue. While in this state, ghosts can be "consumed", and they will return to their spawning area. When Pac Man consumes a ghost, we will gain score. If Pac Man collects all pellets on the map, all pellets will respawn, and Pac Man and the ghosts will be sent to their spawn areas. The goal of the game is to stay alive as long as possible and have as much score as possible by the end.
