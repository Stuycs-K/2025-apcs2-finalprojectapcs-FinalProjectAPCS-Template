### 2025-05-19 - Updated Proposal

Both of us worked on updating the proposal to be more specific regarding the Pokemon chess idea, and we sent the email regarding the revision to the proposal. We spent 25 minutes on this, and we will spend the rest of the class period beginning to build the prototype.

At home: I updated the prototype description with more details on the exact things we will be implementing in our critical features and nice-to-have features in list format (note: had to take a few commits debugging). I also added a timeline of what our workflow will likely look like. (Total time elapsed ~40-50 minutes).
