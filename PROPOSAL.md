Leonardo Benitez and Vanna Lei

# IDEAS:

1)

Recreating Block Blast. Random blocks are given and they must be placed within the 8x8 board and if a row is filled, then the row clears. If none of the pieces fit, then game over. The goal of the game is to get the most amount of points. Different combos have different scores and there can be different game modes where one starts with no blocks and the other starts with random blocks already on the board.

Implementation:
8x8 2D array; generate 3 random blocks; update scores with different combinations; detect game when no blocks fit.

2)

3072 (2048 but starting with 3 and multiplied with powers of 2);
There will be up down left right and added special powerups to make it easier (or harder) to get to 3072.
implementation - 4x4 2d array.

3)

Connect 4 with a slightly larger board, but special abilities such as flipping the board counterclockwise or clockwise, defying gravity, super pieces (where they can remove the other pieces around them once it lands). There can also be an undo button and holes in the grid and power ups that can be collected throughout the game. The concept is similar to the many things that uno has.
