# IDEAS:

1 Balatro Clone: [Steam page with gameplay mechanics] (https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/)[Rules and tips](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3166504510)

    We will be making a clone of balatro, which includes many different objects and subclasses. 
    The main difficulty will be creating the cards and their mechanics.
    These mechanics include dragging cards, selecting cards, hovering over cards, and giving the cards their proper fields.
    There will be many types of cards, being Jokers, Tarot cards, Planet cards, Spectral cards, and playing cards.
    The playing cards are quite complicated, as they are able to have multiple properties, which affect scoring(see line 19), and they have to interact with other cards that modify them.
    Tarot cards and spectral cards generally interact with playing cards and jokers, either generating them or adding properties.
    Planet Cards are the simplest, as they only modify numbers.
    Jokers will affect almost everything, so they are the hardest to implement.
    Scoring includes the calculation of numbers, as well as verifying certain conditions for jokers to trigger. This also includes determining hand types, also well as card modifications. The most immportant part of Balatro scoring is scoring order, as cards will gives +Numbers, or xNumbers, as well as trigger other cards, which includes the previous + and x.
    We may not include all the jokers/difficulties/settings/bosses/graphics, because of time.



2 [2D Portal](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/404612):
    The original game is a flash puzzle-platformer game based on Portal. It uses most of the basic mechanics of the original Portal game. Puzzles rooms are much simpler, and levels are in 2D. We plan to recreate some of the levels and implement the basic mechanics and features of the game.
    Mechanics examples: Basic platformer physics, shooting and placing portals, portal physics, moving platforms, different types of material (if you can or can't place portals on it)

3 Minesweeper (+ variants):
    First we will create basic Minesweeper (based on [Google Doodle Minesweeper](https://www.google.com/fbx?fbx=minesweeper)specifically). We will implement level generation with mines and mechanics of clearing the board. If that is too easy to implement (because we are finished early), we will then add "variants", or modes, taken from the game [14 Minesweeper Variants](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1865060/14_Minesweeper_Variants/). These variants can change the rules of generation and playing the game. The steam game also implements a bunch of side features, such as hints, in-game drawing tools, and level/difficulty selection.
