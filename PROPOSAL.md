# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:
Ideas:


Seth Fenton - Jai Shah

This is terribly formatted and lacks photos we added to demonstrate some features, committed a pdf under Proposal-1 with both better formatting and the photos, this is also here but please look at that if you can.



Government Budget Simulator

Deficit Clock

Government Spending on Different Sectors

Subsidies

GDP Clock

Scrapes real world top 10 economies data allowing you to play as any government in the last 15 years that has easily available data

Honestly maybe use the GPT API to search it instead of just directly scraping (4k tokens per convo should be more than enough), have it list top ten trade partners in array form

Give random positive and negative events

Print Debt To GDP

People happiness value in utils, calculated by taking a standard human development growth curve and adjusting it by gdp per capita using random formula I’ll come up with based on vibes and testing
Print trade surplus (negative if deficit)

https://us.abalancingact.com/federal-budget-simulator this but with a smaller US focus and a much smaller focus on the GUI, also ours will progress over time and have a pause button, instead of just being a single thing, closer metaphor is probably like the TNO Mod of hoi 4 but no alt history and no relative focus on the Gui




As you can see gpt auto creates a class we can make a subclass of a trade partners class to grab all the values,

Gpt token limit on a conversation is 4k so about 3000 words, we should need much less to preload all values

This is honestly my favorite idea ever please let us do it


Chemical Reaction Simulator

Has a databank of reaction constants/characteristics and the capacity to search the web for more (specifically NIST chemical reactants database) https://kinetics.nist.gov/kinetics/

Models independent molecules directly on screen using circles of radii determined with a periodic table library (which has to exist), visual effects are probably coded in processing for ease

Code in gravity and most other fundamental forces that are easy to calculate, when gases are used leverage ideal gas laws so as to not have to do calculus

I can’t think of a chemical reaction simulator off the top of my head but I’m sure one exists we can feasibly copy

Orbital Laser Simulator
A straight rip of nuke map, they probably use the google maps api which I believe is free to use for any project 

Have to do slightly different math with lasers but the display can be fairly similar though likely much more simplified 

Six size of laser options + six distance from the surface of the planet options (assume that changes something but not sure, would have to check)  and the ability to customize lasers 

Calculate damage based on gas composition of the atmosphere and let the user select gas composition and density

Probably much worse graphics
