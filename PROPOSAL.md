# IDEAS:

1. Cookie Clicker Crush (Cookie Clicker + Candy Crush):
Based on: 
https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/
https://www.king.com/game/candycrush/
This will work like Candy Crush, focusing on making swaps and clearing the board by earning the most points. However, in order to earn swaps, you click a cookie and per set amount of cookies, you earn 1 swap. There will be a time limit for how long you have per round. We may add power ups from clicking the cookies.

2. Vampire Survivors Parody
This will work similar to Vampire Survivors. The player will control a character with the keyboard and have automatic attacks. Enemies will converge upon the playerâ€™s location until they are all wiped out. There will be three stages and the player will be able to choose between different sets of gear. However, there will be no leveling up or attaining new weapons during a game.

3. MONOPOLY:
This will work almost exactly like a normal game of monopoly with two d6 dice. We will create our own assets to use and each game will support up to 4 human players and at minimum 2.
