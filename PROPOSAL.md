# IDEAS:

1. [Pac-Man](https://www.pacman.com/en/) The map will be done with an array, with different numbers or characters representing walls, orbs, power ups, ghosts, etc. The player character will also be on this array. Displaying will work with each value in the array being a colored square depending on what it is.

2. [Horse Race Tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcKduq72F3s) This is effectively a horse racing simulator. As for gameplay, the player will have a limited amount of blocks per level. They will choose a horse to bet on, and have to strategically use these blocks to prevent the other horses from reaching the finish line, and to help their horse finish first. As for implementation, courses will be made using arrays, similar to as explained above in Pac Man. The movement of horses will be randomized at the start, and further movement will be determined by bouncing similar to the Orb Physics project.

3. [Tower Defense Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense) The map will once more be done using an array, with characters representing free space and the balloons path with letters, and the actual enemies and player units represented with numbers. Enemies will move along the path, and when they get the end zone, reduce player HP. Units will use an attack function on the enemy closest to the front of the line. When all enemies in a stage die, a new group will begin spawning.
