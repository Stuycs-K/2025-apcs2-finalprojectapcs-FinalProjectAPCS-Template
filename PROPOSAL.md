# IDEAS:

1 Super Smash Bros ( To keep it simple just a single round, no character selection, something like Super Smash Flash)

2 diep.io ( to simulate the other people probably program the other players they way they do pac-man, offensive, defensive, runs away, keeping the enemies not too complicated)

3 Flappy Bird
