Mini Golf - Many levels with high scores. Also has a menu that allows for single player mode and double player mode (1v1). Pulling would determine the direction and power of the ball.

3 statement of the problem you are solving and/or a high level description of the project. (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)
Block Blast - 8x8 grid with a menu containing 3 pieces at the bottom of the screen. Displays score and combo count at the top of the screen. Higher combo means more points. Clears spots when full. Would allow to drag the pieces onto the board. Might add shadows when placing pieces.
