# IDEAS
1. Mirror simulation (This will be a convex / concave lens/mirror simulator. We will have varying variables such as index of refraction, diameter of mirror/lens, etc. Additionally, we will allow the reflected objects to be drawn by the user.). We will be taking influence from this physics simulation: https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/geometric-optics.

2. This will be a 2048-based game in which the numbers you get upon combining two blocks is the next Fibonacci number, with the blocks starting at 1. Every time the player moves the blocks using the up, down, left, right arrows, another block will spawn randomly in one of the empty squares. You can only combine two blocks if they are consecutive Fibonacci numbers. The goal of the game is to get to the number 2584.  

3. Tetris (we have now run out of ideas, and therefore will be taking inspiration from some of our unnamed classmates, who have taken inspiration from tetr.io)
