# IDEAS:

1 Super Smash Bros 

A simplified two-player fighting game inspired by Super Smash Flash. To keep it manageable: just a single round, no character selection, and fixed characters with basic moves. Focus will be on knockback physics, health/damage system, and it actually being playable.

2 diep.io 

A top-down tank shooter where the player fight against multiple enemies with assigned movement and attack patterns. Some enemies will chase the player, others will shoot while keeping distance, and some might be random or run away. The main features will be shooting mechanics, the health and xp system, upgrades, and interesting enemies for varied gameplay.

3 Flappy Bird

A faithful remake of Flappy bird. Just the classics, tep-to-jump, pip obstacles, collision detection, tracking the score. Maybe sound effects, a max score, or leaderboard too.
