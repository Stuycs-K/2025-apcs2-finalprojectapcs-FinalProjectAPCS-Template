# IDEAS:

1: One idea that we had was to create a sort of flag-guessing game. Currently, our vision is that you would be given a flag as an image and you would have to type in/input a multiple choice response to determine what flag it is. If you guess correctly, you can move on to the next flag. We would code this by knowing how to add pictures to a Java/Processing code and cycle through multiple pictures on demand. We will also need to either get better at typing input or multiple choice input(should be easier than typing) for Java/Processing. That is the basis of our idea but we are still deciding on other factors such as: should we have different levels to the game- Easy, Medium, Hard? Should we add another trivia about the country at the end--if you guess correctly? Is it possible to import music--such as national anthem to the code? Should we set a trial limit/timer?
