1 statement of the problem you are solving and/or a high level description of the project. (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)

2 [2D Portal](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/404612):
    The original game is a flash puzzle-platformer game based on Portal. It uses most of the basic mechanics of the original Portal game. Puzzles rooms are much simpler, and levels are in 2D. We plan to recreate some of the levels and implement the basic mechanics and features of the game.
    Mechanics examples: Basic platformer physics, shooting and placing portals, portal physics, moving platforms, different types of material (if you can or can't place portals on it)

3 Minesweeper (+ variants):
    First we will create basic Minesweeper (based on [Google Doodle Minesweeper](https://www.google.com/fbx?fbx=minesweeper)specifically). We will implement level generation with mines and mechanics of clearing the board. If that is too easy to implement (because we are finished early), we will then add "variants", or modes, taken from the game [14 Minesweeper Variants](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1865060/14_Minesweeper_Variants/). These variants can change the rules of generation and playing the game. The steam game also implements a bunch of side features, such as hints, in-game drawing tools, and level/difficulty selection.
