# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Sean Chen, Ahana Chandra

# IDEAS:

Our first idea is chess. There are no links we used as inspiration, because... it's chess. Maybe https://www.chess.com/. No modifications, I don't think we can without breaking the game. We can maybe try adding board and piece skins later but that will take time.


Our second idea is minesweeper. Like a 100% copy. If needed we can add modifiers and stuff like self setting bombs or other specials we have to come up with. https://minesweeper.online/ this is the idea we are basing it on.

Our third idea is is Pacman. Also ike a 100% accurate copy. We could add more enemies and powerups maybe after, if possible. https://www.google.com/logos/2010/pacman10-i.html
