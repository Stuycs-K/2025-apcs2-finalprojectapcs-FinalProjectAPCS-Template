2 [2D Portal](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/404612):
    [Here is the original game](https://armorgames.com/play/107/portal-the-flash-version)
    [Alt Link](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/404612)
    The original game is a flash puzzle-platformer game based on Portal. It uses most of the basic mechanics of the original Portal game. Puzzles rooms are much simpler, and levels are in 2D. We plan to recreate some of the levels and implement the basic mechanics and features of the game.
    Mechanics examples: Basic platformer physics, shooting and placing portals, portal physics, moving platforms, different types of material (if you can or can't place portals on it)
