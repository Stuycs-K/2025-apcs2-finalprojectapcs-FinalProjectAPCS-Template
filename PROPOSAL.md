# IDEAS:

1. Code the board game Sorry. We believe this to be a fairly challenging managable project. We would follow all the rules found on the official rulebook found on Wikepedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry!_(game). We are considering maybe adding some sort of chance card system to add some more flare but are unsure.

2. Making a Flappy Bird game with random infinite generation. This is generally on the less challenging side but can still pose significant difficulties. We would base it off this website: https://flappybird.io/#google_vignette.

3. Our most challenging but exciting idea is to make Billiards/8 Ball. This is likely the most challenging but we think we can do it. We would base it off of the GamePidgeon IOS imessage game or the app 8 Ball Pool. We would use conventional rules found here: https://www.colorado.edu/umc/sites/default/files/attached-files/8-ball_rules_bca.pdf.
