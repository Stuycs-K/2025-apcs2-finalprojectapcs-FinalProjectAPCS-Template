Seth Fenton - Jai Shah

This is terribly formatted and lacks photos we added to demonstrate some features, committed a pdf under Proposal-1 with both better formatting and the photos, this is also here but please look at that if you can.



Government Budget Simulator
1. Deficit Clock
2. Government Spending on Different Sectors
3. Subsidies
4. GDP Clock
5. Yfinance4j will be used as a library to bring up basic economic data
6. Give random positive and negative events
7. Print Debt To GDP
8. People happiness value in utils, calculated by taking a standard human development growth curve and adjusting it by gdp per capita using random formula I’ll come up with based on vibes and testing
9. Print trade surplus (negative if deficit)
10. Effectively give people options on how to proceed as standard buttons, they have the goal of keeping happiness up and if it ever reaches zero, game over
closer metaphor is probably like the TNO Mod of hoi 4 but no alt history and no relative focus on the Gui

Chemical Reaction Simulator

Has a databank of reaction constants/characteristics and the capacity to search the web for more (specifically NIST chemical reactants database) https://kinetics.nist.gov/kinetics/

Models independent molecules directly on screen using circles of radii determined with a periodic table library (which has to exist), visual effects are probably coded in processing for ease

Code in gravity and most other fundamental forces that are easy to calculate, when gases are used leverage ideal gas laws so as to not have to do calculus

I can’t think of a chemical reaction simulator off the top of my head but I’m sure one exists we can feasibly copy

Orbital Laser Simulator
A straight rip of nuke map, they probably use the google maps api which I believe is free to use for any project 

Have to do slightly different math with lasers but the display can be fairly similar though likely much more simplified 

Six size of laser options + six distance from the surface of the planet options (assume that changes something but not sure, would have to check)  and the ability to customize lasers 

Calculate damage based on gas composition of the atmosphere and let the user select gas composition and density

Probably much worse graphics
