# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Ardian Agoes & Stephen Chen

# IDEAS:

1. Battleship 
2 player turn-based game where users each place ships randomly on a grid and take turns guessing where the opponent placed their ships. MVP includes grid structure, special moves like cluster bombs, etc. Possibly aim for detailed animations and special abilities like ability to move ships mid game. (Special move for different types of ships?)

2. Monopoly
Digital version of Monopoly with dice rolling (possible animation), figurines moving across the board, buy properties, hotels, and pay other players. Simplify by skipping auctions and chance/community cards. Probably the most complex idea. 

3. Connect 4
Dropping discs in a 7 column grid — First to connect 4 in a row wins. Easiest idea, mostly focus on board rendering and win detection. Will definitely do animation if this project is chosen. Possibly add new features like power-ups (ie remove one of the opponent’s pieces)
