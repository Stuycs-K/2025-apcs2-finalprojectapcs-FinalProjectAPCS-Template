# IDEAS:

Code the board game Sorry. We beleive this to be fairly challenging but on the more managable side. We would follow all the rules found on the official rulebook found on Wikepedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry!_(game). We are considering maybe adding some sort of chance card system but are unsure.

Making a flappy bird game with random infinite generation. This is generally on the less challenging side but would still pose significant difficulties. We would base it off this website: https://flappybird.io/#google_vignette.

Our most challenging but exciting idea is to make billiards/8 Ball. This is likely the most challenging but we think we can do it. We would base it off of the gamePigeon ios imessage game; so there is not really a link I can put.
