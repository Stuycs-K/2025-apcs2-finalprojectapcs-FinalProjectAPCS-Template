### 2025-05-22 - Brief description :Started classes, made a few edits to prototype

Expanded description: 
- did everything in prototype (revamped to put more detail in order to be more in line with class website)
- still waiting on partner to join repo and commit something 
- wrote abstract class Piece
- created new tabs, started writing subclasses Rook, Bishop, Queen 


### 2025-05-23 - improving Piece, writing new classes
- added some new stuff to prototype
- wrote Piece class, waiting on partner to write Board class to implement last method 
- wrote Pawn, didn't finish implementing all methods


### 2025-05-27 - wrote most of Pawn
- a little behind on schedule, writing Pawn took a lot of time to flesh out and plus I had to go back to edit Piece in places it was missing
- edited prototype, i realize we need a better UML diagram 
- helped partner with branch stuff
