Wrote much of nationStates early functions and the constructor we will probably use for most applications, also wrote a Bonds class, will update prototype later for why that decision was made. Probably took about an hour fifteen minutes, maybe a little more across class time and homework time. Will work a bit more on nationState functions today now that I've fixed all compilation errors, probably another thirty or so minutes.

### 2025-05-26
Wrote more nationStates functions, will clean up GDP Growth tonight once I figure out by sector additions to GDP and then will have a pretty damn good nationStates class minus potential algorithmic changes later on, which will be perfect to do the next phase of the project with. 

### 2025-05-27
Cleaned up nationState GDP Growth, took longer then expected to manage sector by sector growth, joy calculations and inflation.

### 2025-05-28
Spent all day reworking national debt handling, but now it mostly looks pretty normal. Modeled debt traps with joy decrease but might need to come up with better punishments later on. Still pretty solid though.
