### 2025-05-22 - Absent
My sister was graduating and I couldn't miss that so unfortunately I was not in class. Sorry about that.

### 2025-05-25 - Map Class
I started on the Map class, getting the basic functions in and adding things that I forgot to consider when making the UML diagrams.
Finished getMap which turns a premade text file into a map arr
Finished createPellets which sets all empty spaces in a map into pellets.
Started on the Ghost class, added a constructor that takes a map.
Also added a move() command, added isOnScreen() to the Map class, added better and more set and get functions to Map.
Updated getMap so that maps don't have to have spaces in between tiles.
