# Project Design
_**Period 4**_
<br>
**Group Members:** Andy Li and Naomi Hsieh
<br>
**Group Name:** TBD
<br>
**Brief Project Summary**: 
Our created project will be Pokemon Chess. The final product will act exactly like standard chess, with proper movement of pieces, proper checkmate and stalemate rules, as well as techniques such as en passant and castling. However, the pieces will be Pokemon-themed, with each piece represented by the face of a pokemon that reflects the piece's name/purpose. This game will be turn-based and played by two people on the same device.
<br>
**Critical Features (MVP):** For the minimum viable product, we want to have the icons of the pieces designed and completed. We want to be able to set up the board (grid and proper piece placement) upon the start of the program. Once the program is being run, we want to ensure that the standard chess experience can be carried out. We need to ensure that the program can detect illegal movements and prevent them from occurring, and we need to ensure that the program knows when the game ends. We also need to implement proper piece behavior, including their movement and capturing of other pieces. We need to make sure that the grid can reflect changes, such as a piece being removed or promoted.
<br>
**Nice to Have Features:** Once the MVP has been completed, we plan on drastically improving the User Interface. We want the user to see available positions that a clicked-on piece can move by highlighted grids. Furthermore, we want to make the grids more interesting by laying a Pokeball pattern on them, staying true to the whole Pokemon theme. We would polish the designs of the Pokemon icons and change colors (regular vs. shiny) between the pieces of Player 1 and Player 2 to easily differentiate them, rather than doing something more basic like different color outlines. The UI would also be improved in other aspects like the pawn promotion screen. We would include other additional features, such as drawing and forfeiting. If time provides and if feasible enough, we would look into audio and might add a soft Pokemon theme for the background, or the cries of Pokemon as they capture a piece.
