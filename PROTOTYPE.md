# Section 1: Description

Note: this is modified to not be a printed copy, so some thigs may reference "printed" but that is outdated.

    PERIOD 3
    Group members names: Leonardo Benitez and Vanna Lei
    
    Group Name (be creative and lean into it!) BlockBlastBananas

    Brief Project description (1 paragraph summary):
      - Our group is going to recreate the amazing Block Blast Game. There will be 2 different game modes: one that starts with an empty board and another one with random pieces
      filled in. There were be three random pieces generated for you to fit in the board. You will use arrow keys (or drag and drop if we have time) to move the pieces onto the board.
      The row gets cleared and you get points after the row is filled with blocks, just like the game. The score will be placed on the top and it will also account for combos.

    Critical features (Minimum Viable Product) - What you want to have after 1.5 weeks.
     - After 1.5 weeks, our MVP would be the creation of game board, pieces, random piece generator, and an attempt to move and place blcoks.

    Nice to have features - What you would want to have by the end
     - Drag and drop blocks instead of moving them using arrow keys; different themes/game modes. 

# Section 2: UML

UML Diagram (see below) that shows your class heirachy.

Outline of how methods will fit together.

Note: Depending on the style of project you may have more diagram and less outline or vice versa)

# Section 3: Development Phases/Stages

Each phase should have:

    multiple bulletpoints and sub-points to make it easy to see what was completed via checking off things.
    Ideas on how to break up the work (can be modified if some parts are easier/harder than originally planned)
    Leave some space between sections to add/edit the document.

Optional but Good to have: Images (labeled for clarity) can be included to help indicate your intentions.
