# Technical Details:

(CHANGE THIS!!!!!)

A description of your technical design. This should include:

How you will be using the topics covered in class in the project.

# Project Design

UML Diagrams and descriptions of key algorithms, classes, and how things fit together.



# Intended pacing:

How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.

A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project. (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)


# Section 1: Description

Note: this is modified to not be a printed copy, so some thigs may reference "printed" but that is outdated.

    PERIOD 3
    Group members names: Leonardo Benitez and Vanna Lei
    Group Name (be creative and lean into it!) BlockBlastBananas
    Brief Project description (1 paragraph summary):
      Our group is going to recreate the amazing Block Blast Game. There will be 2 different game modes: one that starts with an empty board and another one with random pieces
      filled in. There were be three random pieces generated for you to fit in the board. You will use arrow keys (or drag and drop if we have time) to move the pieces onto the board.
      The row gets cleared and you get points after the row is filled with blocks, just like the game. The score will be placed on the top and it will also account for combos.

        Critical features (Minimum Viable Product) - What you want to have after 1.5 weeks.
        Diagrams can be useful (but will expand this to an extra page if you use them) when your project isn't EXTREMELY well known (e.g. chess, tetris) but you need to annoatate them to explain what you care about.
        Nice to have features - What you would want to have by the end

# Section 2: UML

UML Diagram (see below) that shows your class heirachy.

Outline of how methods will fit together.

Note: Depending on the style of project you may have more diagram and less outline or vice versa)

# Section 3: Development Phases/Stages

Each phase should have:

    multiple bulletpoints and sub-points to make it easy to see what was completed via checking off things.
    Ideas on how to break up the work (can be modified if some parts are easier/harder than originally planned)
    Leave some space between sections to add/edit the document.

Optional but Good to have: Images (labeled for clarity) can be included to help indicate your intentions.
