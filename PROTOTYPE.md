Tetris Gaming but We Can't Play Tetris

A description of your technical design. This should include: 

   We will be creating a recreation of the singleplayer Tetris. We will try to also add our personal touch to the game. 
The game itself will function in processing, and we want to make it somewhat smooth in terms of animation (but still have the blocks
move like they would in the original game). Personal touches could be concerning the speed and actually tiles released, with one of our main gimmicks
being "modes". Such modes could be "Floor is Lava" (where certain levels become unbreakable after a certain time) and having new tiles, etc.

# Project Design

UML Diagrams and descriptions of key algorithms, classes, and how things fit together.


    
# Intended pacing:

How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.

A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project. (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)
