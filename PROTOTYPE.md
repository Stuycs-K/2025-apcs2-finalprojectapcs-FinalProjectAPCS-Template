PERIOD 4
Amrit Das, Harrison Lee
Group Name: TBD[Harrison out on Monday]

Our project aims to create a digital Scrabble game, with useful consumer interactions. We will use code to go through dictionaries in order to load words which have 7-letters and then use things like classes in order to create tiles. Currently, our vision is that we can have an overarching "Tile" class where the players can use and interact with these tiles to play the game. We believe we will need to get better and taking in user input--especially a sort of drag function. (new, Harrison--edit/add more here after AP on Monday)
# Technical Details:

(CHANGE THIS!!!!!)

A description of your technical design. This should include: 
   
How you will be using the topics covered in class in the project.
     
# Project Design

UML Diagrams and descriptions of key algorithms, classes, and how things fit together.


    
# Intended pacing:

How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.

A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project. (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)

Phase 1(deadline- Tuesday after Memorial Day): After finalizing details, two things: 1) Find the dictionary(dictionaries) we want to use. 2) Start coding on the Tile Class

Phase 2(deadline- 5/30): 1) Start working on animation part of the game and try to figure out how to work on not making the game lag

Phase 3(deadline-6/6): 1) Ensuring the game actually works

Phase 4(deadline- 6/13[due date]): 1) Debugging and adding anything potentially useful
