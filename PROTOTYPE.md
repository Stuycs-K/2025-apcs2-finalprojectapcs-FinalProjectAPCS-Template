## Plants vs Crumbies (cause we ate ðŸ’…ðŸ’…ðŸ˜‹)

## Project Description
We want to incorporate a basic rendition of the game with waves of zombies with different defense abilities (newspaper, bucket head), different plants, and periodic sun production. The plants will have cooldowns as to when they are planted as well as special abilities for when they are fed plant food. The game ends after a specific amount of ticks has passed and the remaining zombies of the board are all killed, or when a zombie gets past all the plants and reaches the other side of the map. For the spawning of the waves, we plan to use two lists or a similar data structure to link spawnables and their spawn times. We also want to include a catalogue of descriptions for the different types of plants and zombies. We can make our own version of the PVZ music.

## Expanded Description

### MVP
1.) The background will imported directly from the game. There should be at least one level, and a custom lawn will be generated.
2.) We will have an abstract class called Plants. We need to have at least two Plant objects: PeaShooter and SunFlower. Each plant will have a health bar and damage. Methods include attack(), addSun(),
