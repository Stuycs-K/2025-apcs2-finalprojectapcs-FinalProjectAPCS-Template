Period 3
Owen Zeng, Steven Wu
Minesweepers (placeholder)

First we will create basic Minesweeper (based on [Google Doodle Minesweeper](https://www.google.com/fbx?fbx=minesweeper)specifically). We will implement level generation with mines and mechanics of clearing the board. If that is too easy to implement (because we are finished early), we will then add "variants", or modes, taken from the game [14 Minesweeper Variants](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1865060/14_Minesweeper_Variants/). These variants can change the rules of generation and playing the game. The steam game also implements a bunch of side features, such as hints, in-game drawing tools, and level/difficulty selection.

MVP: We will have created basic Minesweeper. It will have features such as:
Selection of difficulty (board size & mine count)
Generation of valid board/Mine layout
Revealing and Flagging of tiles, Check for win/loss

Nice to have features: 
Different modes/variations that change up the rules for mines/clearing.
Example: Guessing mode, where the there will be sections where you are forced to guess.
In-game drawing tools (writing on the screen)
Menu/Level layout: 
    Skip & Retry level
    Hints
