# Technical Details:

We will have a Piece class that is the parent class, and subclasses will be Pawn, Bishop, Knight, King, Queen, Rook.

We will use processing to display the board.

We will have a int[][] where 0 = empty space, 1 = pawn, 2 = bishop, 3 = knight, 4 = rook, 5 = queen, 6 = King

We will have a counter for the value of the pieces taken.

We will use recursion or loop through the entire array of board to update the board visually with indicators for where pieces can move.


# Project Design

UML Diagrams and descriptions of key algorithms, classes, and how things fit together.



# Intended pacing:

How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.

A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project. (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)
