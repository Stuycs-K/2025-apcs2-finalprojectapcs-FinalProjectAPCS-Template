Brief Description: 

An economics simulator where the player will be able to manage the fiscal and monetary policies of a government operating within a real world national economy. This simulator will include interest rates, a full government budget accounting for most major sectors and the capacity to modify all of these things to produce a stronger economy. 
It will also hopefully include international trade, a human development index modifier and the happiness of the people in utils.

A description of your technical design. This should include: 

Minimum Viable Product: 

1. A domestic economy simulator with a collective of playable nations (likely including America, Germany, China and Japan) editable interest rates, government budgets in atleast four sectors (eg. manufacturing, healthcare, salaries, millitary)
2. Calculations of critical economic indicators including Real GDP, Real GDP Per Capita, Nominal GDP, Nominal GDP per capita, inflation rate, Government debt
3. Changing ease of economic growth depending upon global conditons generated by a combination of random and fixed events (year dependent)
4. Time progression incremented by month
5. Command line input taken from the player


How you will be using the topics covered in class in the project
1. We'll use a nation class that will contain functions to calculate our major economic indicators (will function as our major parent class) (this will provide us the capacity to add more nation states in for a dynamic trade system and go beyond our minimum viable product)
2. We'll use sorting to derive a dynamic list of top ten nations by GDP (initially this will just include your nation of it makes it, plus the other nations real world GDPs but we hope to change that after minimum viable product is achieved)
3. We'll initially use the command line to take player input using the method we learned in class though we'll later modify that to use widgets once we achieve minimum viable product
4. We will use command line graphics initially for the minimum viable product that we learned in class and swap to processing graphics once we developed widgets which we also learned in class
5. We'll likely use many scanners to take text input, all learned in class

# Project Design

UML Diagrams and descriptions of key algorithms, classes, and how things fit together.


    
# Intended pacing:

How you are breaking down the project and who is responsible for which parts.

Full Nation Class With All Indicator Methods Complete - Seth and Jai will both work on this just due to it being a critical part of the project that really needs to work
