Group Name: TBD[Harrison out on Monday]

Our project aims to create a digital Scrabble game, with useful consumer interactions. We will use code to go through dictionaries in order to load words which have 7-letters and then use things like classes in order to create tiles. Currently, our vision is that we can have an overarching "Tile" class where the players can use and interact with these tiles to play the game. We believe we will need to get better and taking in user input--especially a sort of drag function. (new, Harrison--edit/add more here after AP on Monday)
