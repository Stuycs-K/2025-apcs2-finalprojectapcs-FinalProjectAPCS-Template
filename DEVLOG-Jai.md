### 2025-05-22 - Worked on Events
Wasn't here in APCS, wrote up Events in 16 min after discussion. Spent another 7 min planning out how events will function and finishing the class, including adding new accessor methods

### 2025-05-26 - Working through UML & Events
Worked on UML in class, figured out how the Events should work with one another. Wrote basic events for countries as placeholders until we figure out specific calculations

### 2025-05-27 - Finished Run & most of Events
Finished all of run, need exceptions for edge cases but mostly good as is, Events should properly process the text file but needs more review, eventsMaker uses an old method and needs fixing.

### 2025-05-27 - Finished Events, merged and compiled
Managed to finish events, merged classes and figured out how to make everything compile, now need to finish & make sure everything is properly called.
