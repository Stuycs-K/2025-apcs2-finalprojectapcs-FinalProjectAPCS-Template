## Alexander Chen

### 2025-05-19 Worked on prototype, updated the DEVLOG and added a preliminary UML diagram
Planned a proposal in google docs with my partner during class and commited these changes into the doc. Also started canva work on the UML and made some progress in the broadstroke classes that we plan to use. Took about 41 minutes (or 1 period.)

### 2025-05-20 Worked on UML diagram.
Partner and I added some extra parts and clarity for which methods are in each class, what they return and if they are private are public. Still requires some work.

### 2025-05-20 Finished on the first prototype file
Worked on the UML diagram, optimizing layouts and cutting out unneeded methods and how the work was going to be divided afterschool. Around 30-ish minutes

### 2024-01-02 - Brief description
